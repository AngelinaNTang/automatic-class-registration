# automatic-class-registration

Created by: Angelina Tang

This program is meant to help students automatically register for their classes or replace their classes. This program will only work for the University of Washington
registration system.

The schedule(s) that you want need to be in order of preference. You must first state how many schedules and then how many classes in each schedule. Then list the
schedule by doing the sln first, the number of credits next (if you don't want to set a number of credits put 0), and the name of the course without any spaces.

Please read Courses.txt file an example file of how to set up your schedules.


Planned changes:
 > Add a UI through a web browser
 > upload to AWS so it can run automatically
